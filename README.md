This CSS style files contain fixed Sitecore 8 CSS styles in order to display it in more user-fiendly manner without those huge paddings and monstruous elements coming with Sitecore 8. They are terrible and do not fit small screens, like those most of laptops have.

Installation:
	Just copy all those files into your Sitecore 8 instancce web root and agree to replace files.

As all these files are CSS - they would not hurt your instance in any way. However I recomment to create a back-up of \sitecore\shell\Themes\Standard\Default folder, just in case you would need to return to original look-and-feel.


Please read a blog post with more details and screenshots of adjustments:
